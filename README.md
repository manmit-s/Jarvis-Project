# Jarvis - Your Virtual Assistant 🤖

## 🕵‍♂️ About the Project
**Jarvis** is a personalized virtual assistant developed as part of a learning session while watching Python tutorials from **Code With Harry**. Despite following the tutorial, I added my own touch and extended the project to integrate APIs, making it more functional and tailored to real-world use cases.

Jarvis is designed to help with:
- Retrieving the latest **weather updates** using a **Weather API**.
- Providing **current news headlines** using a **News API**.
- Offering an engaging and interactive assistant experience.

This project is an example of combining learning with creativity to build something functional and personalized.
